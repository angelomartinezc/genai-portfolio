      "Fantastic! With leftover chicken and rice you’ve got a bunch of tasty, quick options. Here are some ideas, plus a version with an Ecuadorian twist you can try:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Chicken Fried Rice (30 min or less)\n",
      "  - Why it’s great: Use cold leftover rice and shredded chicken; a wok or large skillet gets you a fast, flavorful meal.\n",
      "  - Quick setup: Sauté diced onions, garlic, and any veggies you have (peas, carrots, bell pepper). Push to the side, scramble a couple eggs in the pan, then mix in rice and chicken with soy sauce and a splash of sesame oil. Finish with green onions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Arroz con Pollo (One-pot style)\n",
      "  - Why it’s great: Classic Latin dish that’s easy to adapt to leftovers.\n",
      "  - Quick setup: Sauté onion, garlic, and bell pepper. Toast the rice briefly, add tomato sauce or diced tomatoes, broth (or water), cumin, and paprika. Fold in shredded chicken and peas, simmer until the rice is tender. Finish with chopped cilantro or culantro and a squeeze of lime.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Sopa de Pollo y Arroz (Chicken & Rice Soup)\n",
      "  - Why it’s great: Comforting, cozy, and great for using up bits of chicken and rice.\n",
      "  - Quick setup: Sauté onion, carrot, celery; add shredded chicken, broth, and a bit of rice. Simmer until veggies are tender and flavors marry. Add herbs (cilantro or parsley) at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Chicken and Rice Casserole (baked, easy)\n",
      "  - Why it’s great: Cheesy, comforting, and very forgiving with what you have.\n",
      "  - Quick setup: Mix chicken, cooked rice, a creamy sauce (cream of mushroom or a simple bechamel), some veggies (peas or broccoli), top with cheese, bake until bubbly.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Creamy One-Pot Chicken & Rice (risotto-style)\n",
      "  - Why it’s great: Creamy, cozy, and uses pantry staples.\n",
      "  - Quick setup: Sauté onion/garlic, toast the rice briefly, gradually add hot broth while stirring until the rice is almost tender. Stir in shredded chicken and a splash of cream or parmesan.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Quick Arroz Con Pollo with a Ecuadorian twist\n",
      "  - How to give it an Ecuadorian flair: Use culantro or fresh cilantro, a bit of lime juice, and if you have ají amarillo or a pinch of paprika for color and gentle heat. You can also finish with peas and chopped peppers for color.\n",
      "  - Quick setup: Sauté onion, garlic, and bell pepper. Toast the rice, add tomato (or tomato sauce), broth, and a pinch of spices. Stir in chicken, then finish with cilantro or culantro and a light squeeze of lime. Add peas or corn for color.\n",
      "\n",
      "Want me to pull a full, step-by-step recipe from the web for one of these? If you tell me which option you prefer (and any ingredients you definitely have or don’t have), I’ll tailor it and give you precise measurements and steps.\n"

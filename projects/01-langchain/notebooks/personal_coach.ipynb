      "- High protein from chicken helps satiety and muscle maintenance.\n",
      "- Lots of vegetables add volume with few calories.\n",
      "- Uses mostly water/broth (minimal oil) for flavor, with a light starch option if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients (adjust to what you have)\n",
      "- 400–500 g skinless chicken breast or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 medium onion, chopped\n",
      "- 2 garlic cloves, minced\n",
      "- 1 green bell pepper, chopped\n",
      "- 2 carrots, sliced\n",
      "- 1 small zucchini or broccoli florets (optional)\n",

      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- Optional for flavor: 1 bay leaf, pinch chili flakes, a squeeze of lemon, or 1 tsp cumin/paprika\n",
      "- Optional serving add-ins (for texture if you want a small carb): 1/2 cup cooked brown rice or cauliflower rice per portion\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps\n",
      "1) Heat a large pot over medium heat. If you’re avoiding oil, start with a small splash of water or broth to soften the onion and garlic.\n",
      "2) Add onion and garlic; sauté 2–3 minutes until translucent.\n",
      "3) Add chicken pieces; cook 3–5 minutes until lightly browned and mostly cooked through.\n",
